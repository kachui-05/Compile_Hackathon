# AdaptUI — Chrome Extension

Transform any website to match how you browse.

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 👁 Low Vision | Makes everything bigger — zooms the whole page, reflows layout so nothing gets cut off |
| 📖 Focus Read | Dims distracting sidebars, ads, and clutter so you can concentrate on the main content |
| ⚡ Speed | Highlights the important parts of the current site, strips animations, hides noise |

## Intensity Slider
Each mode has 3 intensity levels (Subtle → Moderate → Strong), letting you control how aggressively the page is transformed.

## How it works

- `manifest.json` — Tells Chrome what permissions the extension needs
- `popup.html/js` — The UI panel that appears when you click the extension icon
- `content.js` — Runs on every webpage; injects CSS transformations based on the active mode
- `content.css` — Minimal base stylesheet
- `background.js` — Handles extension icon color changes per mode
- `icons/` — Extension icons

## Project Structure
```
adaptive-ui-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── popup.html
├── popup.js
├── content.js
├── content.css
├── background.js
├── README.md
└── icons/
```

## Adding New Modes

In `content.js`, add a new entry to the `MODES` object:

```js
mymode: (intensity) => `
  /* Your CSS here */
  body { background: red !important; }

`
```

Then add a card for it in `popup.html` with `data-mode="mymode"`.

## Eyetracking
When user is visiting a webpage, our extension tracks user's eye motion to evaluate if the user is focused or distracted and gives feedback based on the mode turned on
